### Experimental analysis of knowledge graph embedding for entity alignment
Knowledge graph (KG) embedding has demonstrated its ef- fectiveness in many areas such as KG completion and question answering. For entity alignment, embedding-based methods expect to learn similar embeddings for aligned entities. However, as an emerging field, there are no benchmark datasets and experimental analysis for embedding-based entity alignment yet. We developed a degree-based sampling method to generate 42 alignment-oriented datasets from real-world large-scale KGs, representing different heterogeneities of the original KGs. We se- lected three state-of-the-art embedding-based entity alignment methods for evaluation and comparison. Furthermore, we observed that multi- mapping relations and literal embedding are the two main obstacles for embedding-based entity alignment and some preliminary solutions were attempted. Specifically, we leveraged several enhanced KG embedding models to handle multi-mapping relations and used word2vec to incor- porate literal similarities into embeddings. Our findings indicate that the performance of existing embedding-based methods is influenced by the characteristics of datasets and not all KG embedding models are suitable for entity alignment. Alignment-oriented KG embedding remains to be explored.
