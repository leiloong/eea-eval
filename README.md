### Experimental analysis of knowledge graph embedding for entity alignment
We developed a degree-based sampling method to generate 42 alignment-oriented datasets from real-world large-scale KGs, representing different heterogeneities of the original KGs. We selected three state-of-the-art embedding-based entity alignment methods for evaluation and comparison. Furthermore, we observed that multimapping relations and literal embedding are the two main obstacles for embedding-based entity alignment and some preliminary solutions were attempted. Specifically, we leveraged several enhanced KG embedding models to handle multi-mapping relations and used word2vec to incorporate literal similarities into embeddings. Our findings indicate that the performance of existing embedding-based methods is influenced by the characteristics of datasets and not all KG embedding models are suitable for entity alignment. Alignment-oriented KG embedding remains to be explored.
